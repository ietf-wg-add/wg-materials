# Setup notes for setting up and managing repositories for the ADD-WG

## Creating 

The ADD-WG github follows the practice of having a repository for each draft document.   

We use the [Setup](https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/master/doc/SETUP.md) written by Martin Thomson.    Note - this runs on the admin's computer and 
requires the installation of the tools describted in the Setup instructions.  The result is then checked into the repository in GitHub

## Adding Weekly summary digests

[ietf-github-serices](https://github.com/ietf-github-services) provides weekly email summaries of GitHub activity.   These are configured by adding the IETF WG 
and repository to be reported to the file mls.json file and submitting the changes as a pull request.
